= xml-validator
Florent Nicoulaud

I needed to validate an XSD file in version 1.1 and could not find anything online.
This is a simple project based on solutions I gathered mostly on stack overflow.
The Java class lets you validate an XML file against an XML Schema (compatible with XSD version 1.1).
